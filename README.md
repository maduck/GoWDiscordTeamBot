you're on your own installing and using this.
Keep in mind I will not be providing the needed game files (World.json and translations).

## install
* install python 3.8
* create a virtualenv "venv"
* install all packages from requirements.txt

## configure
* copy the World.js file to your folder
* update_lang_files.py to download the needed translation files

## run
* export the ENV DISCORD_TOKEN (register the app on discord to get a token)
* run bot.py
